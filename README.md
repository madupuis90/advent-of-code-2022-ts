# Advent of Code in Typescript

I had initially start the AoC in Rust, but decided to put my Rust learning on pause to try to complete all challenges in Typescript.

## Code Structure

The code is split per day : 1, 2, 3, ...25

`npm start <day_number>` will print the solution for both part of that day

`npm test <day_number>` will run the tests using the sample data for that day

`npm run test:watch <day_number>` will continuously run the test for a specific day (used for dev)
